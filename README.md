## About me:
Hi! My name is Alan Zanardi. <br>
I am a neurobiologist with a strong interest in programming (expecially with Pyton and JavaScript).<br>
After a decade immersed in the dynamic realm of biomedical research and driven by my profound passion for decoding meaningful insights from data, I am determined to chart a new course in my professional journey by pursuing a career as a data analyst.
